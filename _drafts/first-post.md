title:  "Doors of knowledge"

Knowledge opens doors, but closes others. Once you think you know something,
you might stop investigating. You might not observe as closely. You might not
check to ensure your knowledge is applicable to new times or circumstances.

To unlearn, you must open a door you have closed, close a door you have opened.
That requires thought and humility. It's easy to be too busy to think or too
prideful to be humble. So it's hard to unlearn.

It seems that moral knowledge is the hardest kind to unlearn. Once you are
convinced that some doors are Good, and others Evil, it becomes hard to
experiment. If you try closing a Good door, or opening an Evil one, you seem to
risk an irreversible transformation. To do so requires courage, or desperation.
